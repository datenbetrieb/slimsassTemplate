# slim/scss boilerplate template
This projects aims to be a boilerplate new tec using template for middleman.
It uses some state of the art technologies for simple frondent development on a rocksolid base.
It will use a lot of ideas from the html5boilerplate project but instead of using traditional web tecs it will use preprocessors.

  * instead of pure html we will use Slim (slim-lang.org) because it is much easier to structure and to read
  * instead of pure css we use the sass (sass-lang.com) preprocessor because it is simply awesome (but we use the newer scss syntax because it is near to classic css)
  * it include compass (compass-styles.org) because it provides a lot of usefull sass mixins which can be uses to improve styling speed
  * as grid-system we use oddbirds susy (susy.oddbird.net)

The folders structure is aligned to the TYPO3 FLOW framework structure for a fast import.
